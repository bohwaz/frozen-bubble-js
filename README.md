# Frozen Bubble (Javascript edition)

This is a fork of Frozen Bubble JS edition from Glenn Sanson, see http://glenn.sanson.free.fr/v2/ for details.

This is exactly the same code as published on http://glenn.sanson.free.fr/v2/content_files/frozenBubble_js.zip

Except it doesn't depend on having PHP or MySQL to play for the game. High score screen still require PHP and JS though.

This was mostly done as a way to play when stuck on an internet kiosk :)

## Demo

You can play by going to https://bohwaz.github.io/frozen-bubble-js/

## Other versions

Another version of Frozen Bubble in JS is available here: https://github.com/alonsovidales/Frozen-Bubble-Chrome-Extension

It has more modern code and is also available as a Chromium extension.

Thanks to the original authors!
